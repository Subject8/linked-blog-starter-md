	- #### How is Time Determined?
		- Time within the universe is determined by the OuterNet Central Systems. The Central Systems views the timestream as a constant, so everyone in the universe can see the same time regardless of relativity. Since there aren't any stars all Domes can sync their Bosons to the same schedule.

			- Each cycle is twelve hours
	- #### Cycle
		- The term used for two Boson cycles
			- The equivalent of 24 hours

		- (Cuh-lass) Any stellar body is put into a class of how dense the gravity on the surface is. This can be affected by other objects nearby, black holes, or even high volume material. 
			- Ex: Black holes are A-Class, gas giants or planets near black holes have B class, the average Dome has C-Class, the average moon has D-Class, and F-Class is zero gravity.
			- Earth would be considered C-Class
	- #### Slag
		- (S-lag) Slag is the main weapon used within the universe. Slag is iron oxide that has been superheated to the material's critical point. At this stage the iron oxide doesn't follow the laws of physics and thermodynamics. When struck with slag it will burn through most armor types, flesh, and bone. It also is easily able to go up to 20 times the speed of sound when pressurized. However, slag is known to be used in every type of weapon, swords, guns, gauntlets, etc. No weapon can compete with slag.
