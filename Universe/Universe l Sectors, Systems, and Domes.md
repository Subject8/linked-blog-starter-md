- # Overview
	- The universe is split up into four sectors, or sects, each of them are ruled by the controlling governments. These sectors have fluctuated over the years through battles of territory control, often new systems of planets are discovered which leads to governments fighting for the resources on them. When looking at a system from largest body to smallest it goes sector, system, dome.
		- Example: 
			- The Ascendancy - Sector
			- Alpha - System
			- Alpha 1 - Dome
- # Territory (Biggest to Smallest)
	- #### How is a System Determined?
		- A system is defined by a cluster of at least 3 Domes, although the average system has around 5. Planets that haven't been turned into domes or gravity locked into a system are considered Null.
		- Domes use specific letters and numbers to identify the purpose of the planet. This is to support ease of travel for tourists, shipping, and various other companies.
			- First Number: When the planet was established within the system in order
			- First Letter: What the planet's primary purpose is
				- T: Tourism
				- C: Commercial
				- B: Corporate
				- M: Military
				- I: Industrial
				- R: Residential
				- X: Capital of the system
					- This is seen in conjunction with another letter
			- Second Number: Population (Always seen after the letter & there is only one capital per sector) 
				- 0: >1,000
				- 1: 1,001 > 100,000
				- 2: 100,001 > 500,000
				- 3: 500,001 > 1,000,000
				- 4: 1,000,001 > 50,000,000
				- 5: 50,000,001 > 500,000,000
				- 6: 500,000,001 > 1,000,000,000
				- 7: 1,000,000,001 > 5,000,000,000
				- 8: 5,000,000,001 > 10,000,000,000
				- 9: <10,000,000,001
