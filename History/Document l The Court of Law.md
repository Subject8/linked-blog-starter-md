2. The education of citizens shall span a minimum of 25 years, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of various scientific disciplines, critical thinking, and the development of innovative ideas.
3. By grade 10, citizens shall choose their area of specialization, committing to a specific field of scientific endeavor. Any deviations from this chosen path shall be considered punishable by exile, as it is essential to maintain focus and expertise for the betterment of society.
4. The educational curriculum shall be designed to foster creativity, curiosity, and a deep understanding of scientific principles. It shall also encompass ethical considerations, emphasizing the responsible use of knowledge and technology.
5. Education centers shall be equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, resources, and expert faculty members dedicated to providing a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment for all citizens.

2. To facilitate scientific contributions, the Watchmen shall establish research institutes, laboratories, and collaborative platforms where citizens can engage in cutting-edge research, share knowledge, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. Destruction of any kind to these properties are punishable by exile.
