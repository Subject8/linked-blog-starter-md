		- Us as citizens of The Terran Federation, united in our commitment to justice, equality, and the preservation of life and liberty, hereby declare the following rights and principles as the foundation of our governance.
	- #### Article I: Right to Privacy
		1. The people's rights to privacy behind closed doors shall never be infringed upon. We recognize that personal privacy is essential for fostering individual autonomy, personal development, and the free expression of thoughts and ideas.
		2. No surveillance or intrusion shall be permitted within the private spaces of individuals without justifiable cause and due process of law.
	- #### Article II: Inclusive Citizenship
		1. As long as they do not pose a threat to the population, no species shall be denied citizenship within the domains governed by The Terran Federation. We firmly believe in the inherent worth and dignity of all sentient beings, irrespective of their biological makeup.
		2. The Terran Federation shall ensure that every citizen, regardless of species, receives equal protection under the law, enjoys civil liberties, and has access to essential services and opportunities.
	- #### Article III: Rights of Flora
		1. Recognizing the interconnectedness of all life forms, we grant plants the same rights as animals. They possess inherent value, and their contribution to ecological balance and the well-being of the planet is invaluable.
		2. The destruction or gentrification of plants or their territories within any Dome shall be considered an offense of utmost gravity, equivalent to acts of murder or treason. We shall implement stringent measures to safeguard their habitats and promote the sustainable coexistence of all life forms.
	- #### Article IV: Separation of Military and Government
		1. The military shall remain an independent entity separate from the government. Its primary purpose shall be the protection of the people, defense of the nation, and maintenance of peace, adhering to the principles of international cooperation and diplomacy.
		2. The military shall not possess the authority to impose martial law or engage in acts that infringe upon the civil liberties of the population. The government shall ensure civilian oversight and accountability over military actions.
	- #### Article V: Rehabilitation as the Primary Sentencing
		1. The Terran Federation firmly rejects the concept of imprisonment as a punitive measure. Instead, we prioritize the rehabilitation of individuals who have transgressed societal norms.
		2. Rehabilitation programs shall be designed to address the root causes of criminal behavior, promote personal growth, and facilitate the reintegration of individuals into the community. Restorative justice practices shall guide our approach, seeking healing and reconciliation for both victims and offenders.
	- #### Article VI: Equitable Compensation and Wealth Redistribution
		1. The Terran Federation acknowledges the inherent value of labor and strives to establish a just and equitable economic system. A minimum and maximum wage shall be enforced to ensure fair remuneration for all citizens.
		2. Excessive accumulation of wealth beyond the maximum limit shall be redirected towards initiatives that promote the well-being, education, healthcare, and infrastructure development of all Terran citizens. We aim to bridge socio-economic disparities and foster a society where every individual can thrive.
	- #### Article VII: Protection of Rights
		1. The Terran Federation pledges to uphold and protect the rights of every creature within its jurisdiction. Any infringement upon these rights shall be met with swift and just consequences.

	- #### Article VIII: Democratic Oversight in Military Actions
		1. The decision to engage in war or military action shall never be taken lightly. The Terran Federation recognizes the profound impact such actions have on human lives and the world at large.
		2. Prior to the initiation of any war or military intervention, a referendum shall be held, allowing the people to voice their concerns and exercise their democratic right to decide collectively on matters of war and peace.
	- #### Article IX: Transparent Access to Government Documents
		1. The Terran Federation acknowledges the importance of transparency and accountability in governance. Access to government documents shall be freely available to all citizens, as information belongs to the people it concerns.
		2. Openness in government processes, policies, and decisions fosters informed participation, trust, and collaboration between the people and their elected representatives. The Terran Federation commits to sharing knowledge and empowering its citizens through free access to government information.
	- #### Conclusion:
