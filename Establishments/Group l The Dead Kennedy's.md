- # Overview
	- The Dead Kennedy's are a group of mercenaries and assassins that have banded together to form a union. There are trillions of lifeforms in the universe and thousands of hits are requested every cycle and organized crime makes it that much easier.
- # Policies
	1. It's the universe against us, never turn on another Kennedy under any circumstance: Loyalty among the Dead Kennedy's is paramount. Trust and support your fellow mercenaries at all times, regardless of the situation. Betrayal of a fellow Kennedy is strictly forbidden.
	2. Outsiders are never welcome and should never be trusted: The Dead Kennedy's maintain a strict policy of skepticism towards outsiders. Exercise caution when dealing with individuals who are not part of the group. Trust is earned, and outsiders should be treated with suspicion until proven otherwise.
	3. Send 5% of any payment or haul to HQ out of solidarity: The Dead Kennedy's value solidarity and collective support. As a sign of unity, it is expected that a portion (at least 5%) of any payment or valuable acquisition is contributed to the group's headquarters. This ensures the group's resources and operational capabilities are maintained.
	4. Always answer the call of another Kennedy in need of help: The Dead Kennedy's operate as a tightly-knit family. When a fellow Kennedy is in trouble or requires assistance, it is the duty of every member to respond promptly and provide aid. Remember, you may find yourself in a similar situation someday, and unity is essential for survival.
	5. Applying for citizenship anywhere puts you on grounds for termination: To ensure the safety of all Dead Kennedy's, applying for citizenship or establishing permanent ties to any specific location is strictly prohibited. The group thrives on mobility and the ability to adapt to various situations. Therefore, any member seeking to settle down or establish citizenship elsewhere will be considered a risk and subject to termination.
	6. Once a Kennedy, always a Kennedy: The bond among the Dead Kennedy's is lifelong. Once you become a member of the group, you are forever part of the family. Leaving the group or attempting to sever ties is not an option. Loyalty and commitment are expected, and the group will stand by its members through thick and thin.
These informal rules reflect the unique code of conduct followed by The Dead Kennedy's, emphasizing loyalty, unity, and a cautious approach towards outsiders.
